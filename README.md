# Kickstarting with Excel
Kickstarter Data Analysis
## Overview of Project
I analyzed data from the spreadsheet to compare lauch dates and trends on which goals have been historically met.
### Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to figure out when best to lauch a campaign based on data from launch dates and goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges
Analysis shows the trednds clearly. Challenges can be seen as the percentage of successful campaigns and the percentage of failed campaigns seem to peak and sink at the $20,000 to $29,000 goals.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

This analysis makes it clear the best time to launch a successful campaign is in the month of May.

This analysis makes it clear the most successful campaigns are targeting 25K to 29K. It also shows the highest percentage cancelled is at this same benchmark. This seems to imply something other than the amount of the goal is responsible for canceled campaigns.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results
The best time to launch a campaign is in May. The worst time to launch a campaign is in December.
The goal is not the most important determining factor as to whether a campaign will succeed or fail.
Some limitations on this data set include the age of the data. The most recent data available is more than 10 years old. Also this data is representative of plays in the US only.
We could possibly create a line graph compairing different categories, other than plays, to compare their successes and failures in order to compare trends.
